Task-1: Write a RISC-V assembly program that stores a full 32-bit constant.
• Use the lui instruction to load a 20-bit upper immediate value of your
registration number into the upper 20 bits of a register.
• Use the addi instruction to add the lower 12-bit immediate value of your
registration number to a register.
• Combine both instructions to load a full 32-bit constant into a register.
