Problem: From the last two logs, one can see that the log ‘Job 2 has finished’ is repeated
twice while no log for ‘Job 1 has finished’ is seen.
Why has it occurred?
On observing closely and visualizing the execution of the code, we can see that :
95
 The log ‘Job 2 has started’ is printed just after ‘Job 1 has Started’, so it can easily
be concluded that while thread 1 was processing, the scheduler scheduled thread
2.
 If we take the above assumption as true, then the value of the ‘counter’ variable
got incremented again before job 1 got finished.
 So, when Job 1 actually got finished, then the wrong value of counter produced
the log ‘Job 2 has finished’ followed by the ‘Job 2 has finished for the actual job
2 or vice versa as it is dependent on the scheduler.
 So we see that it is not the repetitive log but the wrong value of the ‘counter’
variable that is the problem.
 The actual problem was using the variable ‘counter’ by a second thread when the
first thread was using or about to use it.
 In other words, we can say that lack of synchronization between the threads while
using the shared resource ‘counter’ caused the problems, or in a word, we can say
that this problem happened due to a ‘Synchronization problem’ between two
threads.
How to solve it?
The most popular way of achieving thread synchronization is by using Mutexes.
